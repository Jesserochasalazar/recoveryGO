# Example environment variables for local development

# Exposed to the client bundle by Expo when prefixed with EXPO_PUBLIC_
# Add your OpenAI key here (do NOT commit a real key)
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=

# Notes:
# - The app also reads OPENAI_API_KEY from expo.extra (see app.config.ts),
#   which is derived from this EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY at build time.
# - Keep your actual .env out of git; .gitignore already ignores .env.
